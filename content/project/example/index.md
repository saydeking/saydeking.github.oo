title: AI-Enabled Deception Detection for Mental Health
summary: This project is comprised of multiple ongoing studies. Currently, we are conducting multimodal data collection to support the exploration of deception detection across video, audio, gaze, and physiological data and across various discussion topics. If you are aged 18-25 years or 35-42 years, and are interested in participating in this study as a research participant, visit the link below! Other project efforts include a survey of the AI-enabled deception detection literature, and qualitative interviews with mental health professionals regarding their perspectives on such technologies in therapeutic settings.
