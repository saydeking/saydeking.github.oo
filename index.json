Currently, we are conducting multimodal data collection to support the exploration of deception detection across video, audio, gaze, and physiological data and across various discussion topics. If you are interested in participating in this study as a research participant, visit the link below. Other project efforts include a survey of the AI-enabled deception detection literature, and qualitative interviews with mental health professionals regarding their perspectives on such technologies in therapeutic settings.","tags":["Artificial Intelligence","Qualitative Research"],"title":"AI-Enabled Deception Detection for Mental Health","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566864e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864e3,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://saydeking.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"This interdisciplinary project includes the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering and Mental Health Law and Policy at the University of South Florida. This study explores the feasibility of a group-based, peer-led intervention for college students experiencing feelings of shame and nervousness regarding mental health challenges they face. The computing side of the project aims to corroborate self-reported measures of mental well-being by developing AI models using smartphone sensing behaviors collected from intervention participants.
