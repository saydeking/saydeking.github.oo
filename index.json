Four themes emerged from coding analysis of the interview data, including Functional Components of the Computer Science Implementation, Perceptions of the Computer Science Implementation, Integration of the Computer Science Implementation, and Suggestions. These themes encompass feedback from practicing mental health professionals  suggesting a potential use case for automated deception detection in mental health, albeit considerations for confidentiality, client autonomy, data access, and therapist-client trust.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Therapist Perceptions of Automated Deception Detection in Mental Health Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1685577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685577600,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://saydeking.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"This project is comprised of multiple ongoing studies.

Unfortunately, people with psychiatric disabilities are less engaged in their campus communities. This work-in-progress paper details the disclosure-based self-stigma reduction program, Up To Me, which is developed to increase inclusion and engagement of people with mental illness on college campuses by teaching strategies to weigh costs and benefits of disclosing one's mental illness. Further, we elaborate on the program's evaluation mechanisms, which involve both self-reported and passively recorded smartphone sensor data. The latter reflects a unique merging of behavioral and computer sciences that serves to facilitate behavioral modeling using artificial intelligence as an objective measure of Up to Me outcomes. Similar to data collection for some activity and biometric recognition applications, we employ a publicly available and free-to-use smartphone sensor reading app to correlate self-reported well-being with Up to Me participant behaviors. We anticipate that the behavioral data gathered via smartphones will substantiate self-report data on Up to Me outcomes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Assessing the Efficacy of a Self-Stigma Reduction Mental Health Program with Behavioral Biometrics - Work-in-Progress","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sayde L.

Specifically, we aimed to investigate the following research questions: How do users perceive the service in relation to stigma, impact of the intervention, and perceived usefulness? How do users rate the Cope Notes service and SMS text messaging along various dimensions of acceptability? What is the relationship between Cope Notes SMS text message ratings, user personality, and coping strategies? What are user perspectives of leveraging ubiquitous sensing technologies to improve delivery and provide tailored content?","tags":[],"title":"Characterizing User Experiences With an SMS Text Messagingâ€“Based mHealth Intervention - Mixed Methods Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566864e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864e3,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://saydeking.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"This interdisciplinary project includes the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering and Mental Health Law and Policy at the University of South Florida.
