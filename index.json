We employ data from 19 subjects using the StudentLife dataset, a dataset collected by researchers at Dartmouth College that was originally collected to correlate behaviors characterized by smartphone usage patterns with changes in stress and academic performance. Although many previous works on behavioral biometrics have implied that mood is a source of intra-person variation which may impact biometric performance, our results contradict this assumption. Our findings show that performance worsens when removing samples that were generated when subjects may be happy, upset, or stressed. Thus, there is no indication that mood negatively impacts performance. However, we do find that changes existing in smartphone usage patterns may correlate with mood, including changes in locking, audio, location, calling, homescreen, and e-mail habits. Thus, we show that while mood is a source of intra-person variation, it may be an inaccurate assumption that biometric systems (particularly, mobile biometrics) are likely influenced by mood.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Studying the Impact of Mood on Identiying Smartphone Users","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sayde L.
