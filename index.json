Four themes emerged from coding analysis of the interview data, including Functional Components of the Computer Science Implementation, Perceptions of the Computer Science Implementation, Integration of the Computer Science Implementation, and Suggestions. These themes encompass feedback from practicing mental health professionals  suggesting a potential use case for automated deception detection in mental health, albeit considerations for confidentiality, client autonomy, data access, and therapist-client trust.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1685577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685577600,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://saydeking.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"This project is comprised of multiple ongoing studies.

Specifically, we aimed to investigate the following research questions: How do users perceive the service in relation to stigma, impact of the intervention, and perceived usefulness? How do users rate the Cope Notes service and SMS text messaging along various dimensions of acceptability? What is the relationship between Cope Notes SMS text message ratings, user personality, and coping strategies? What are user perspectives of leveraging ubiquitous sensing technologies to improve delivery and provide tailored content?","tags":[],"title":"Characterizing User Experiences With an SMS Text Messagingâ€“Based mHealth Intervention - Mixed Methods Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Khadija Zanna","Sayde L.

We employ data from 19 subjects using the StudentLife dataset, a dataset collected by researchers at Dartmouth College that was originally collected to correlate behaviors characterized by smartphone usage patterns with changes in stress and academic performance. Although many previous works on behavioral biometrics have implied that mood is a source of intra-person variation which may impact biometric performance, our results contradict this assumption. Our findings show that performance worsens when removing samples that were generated when subjects may be happy, upset, or stressed. Thus, there is no indication that mood negatively impacts performance. However, we do find that changes existing in smartphone usage patterns may correlate with mood, including changes in locking, audio, location, calling, homescreen, and e-mail habits. Thus, we show that while mood is a source of intra-person variation, it may be an inaccurate assumption that biometric systems (particularly, mobile biometrics) are likely influenced by mood.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Studying the Impact of Mood on Identiying Smartphone Users","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566864e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864e3,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://saydeking.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"This interdisciplinary project includes the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering and Mental Health Law and Policy at the University of South Florida.
