abstract = {Emerging applications in Sensor and Peer-to-Peer networks make the concept of data integration without centralization nowadays more meaningful than ever. In these environments, data is generated continuously and potentially automatically across geographically diverse locations. Organizing data in centralized repositories is becoming prohibitively expensive and in many occasions impractical. Storing data in-situ however, complicates query processing because data relations are fragmented over a number of remote sites. Furthermore, accessing these fragmented relations is only feasible by traversing a network of other nodes. This makes the execution of a query an even more complex task. We claim that in many occasions it might more beneficial to find the K highest ranked (or Top-K) answers, for some user defined parameter K, if this can minimize the query execution cost. In this talk, I will present techniques to efficiently answer Top-K queries in a distributed environment. A Top-K query returns the K highest ranked answers to a user defined similarity function. At the same time it also minimizes some cost metric, such as the utilization of the communication medium, which is associated with the retrieval of the desired answer set. I will provide an overview of state-of-the-art algorithms that solve the Top-K problem in a centralized setting and show why these are not applicable to the distributed case.

Unfortunately, the given model introduces both data-disclosure concerns (e.g., disclosing all captured media to a central entity) and performance concerns (e.g., consuming precious smartphone battery and bandwidth during content uploads). In this paper, we present a novel framework, coined SmartOpt, for searching objects (e.g., images, videos, etc.) captured by the users in a mobile social community. Our framework, is founded on an in-situ data storage model, where captured objects remain local on their owner's smartphones and searches then take place over a novel lookup structure we compute dynamically, coined the Multi-Objective Query Routing Tree (MO-QRT). Our structure concurrently optimizes several conflicting objectives (i.e., it minimizes energy consumption, minimizes search delay and maximizes query recall), using a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) that calculates a diverse set of high quality non-dominated solutions in a single run. We assess our ideas with mobility patterns derived by Microsoft's Geolife project and social patterns derived by DBLP.

abstract = {We present a novel distributed algorithm (MHS) that constructs a query routing tree that minimizes collisions during query execution. It was shown in previous work that minimizing collisions during query execution saves significant amount of energy[1]. In the same paper it is shown that balancing the node degrees of a query routing tree significantly reduces collisions during query execution. We address the inefficiencies of the previously proposed algorithm and propose a simpler, purely distributed, parameter-free, cheaper and more efficient algorithm. Our resulting query trees are optimally balanced, guarantee minimum collisions and minimum latency for query execution and allow for opportunistic in-network processing. MHS poses the minimum possible communication overhead to the network and is parameter-free as opposed to previously proposed algorithms. Our proposed algorithm can be used for acquiring data from the nodes of any distributed systems where the main objective is to minimize the communication cost.},

location = {Lyon, France (The 6th Intl. Workshop on Data Management for Sensor Networks (DMSN09), in conjunction with VLDB09, Lyon, France, 2009)}
abstract = {In long-term deployments of Wireless Sensor Networks, it is often more efficient to store sensor readings locally at each device and transmit those readings to the user only when requested (i.e., in response to a user query). Many of the techniques that collect information from a sensor network require that the data is sorted on some attribute (e.g., range queries, top-k queries, join queries, etc.) Yet, the underlying storage medium of these devices (i.e., Flash media) presents some unique characteristics which renders traditional disk-based sorting algorithms inefficient in this context. In this paper we devise the FSort algorithm, an efficient external sorting algorithm for flash-based sensor devices with a small memory footprint. FSort minimizes the expensive write/delete operations of flash memory minimizing in that way the consumption of energy. In particular, FSort uses a top-down replacement selection algorithm in order to produce sorted runs on flash media in a log-based manner. Sorted runs are then recursively merged in order to yield the sorted result. Our experimentation with real traces from Intel Research Berkeley show that FSort greatly outperforms the traditional External Mergesort Algorithm both in regards to time and energy consumption. We found similar advantages in regards to the wearability constraints of flash media.},

Our objectives are to explore a given geographic region by detecting spatio-temporal events of interest and to store these events in the network until the user requests them. Such a setting finds applications in mobile environments where the user (i.e., the sink) is infrequently within communication range from the field deployment. Our framework, coined SenseSwarm, dynamically partitions the sensing devices into perimeter and core nodes. Data acquisition is scheduled at the perimeter, in order to minimize energy consumption, while storage and replication takes place at the core nodes which are physically and logically shielded to threats and obstacles. To efficiently identify the nodes laying on the perimeter of the swarm we devise the Perimeter Algorithm (PA), an efficient distributed algorithm with a low communication complexity. For storage and fault-tolerance we devise the Data Replication Algorithm (DRA), a voting-based replication scheme that enables the exact retrieval of events from the network in cases of failures. Our trace-driven experimentation shows that our framework can offer significant energy reductions while maintaining high data availability rates. In particular, we found that when failures are less than 60\% failure then we can recover over 80\% of generated events exactly.},

abstract = {Continuous queries in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are founded on the premise of Query Routing Tree structures (denoted as T ), which provide sensors with a path to the querying node. Predominant data acquisition systems for WSNs construct such structures in an ad-hoc manner and therefore there is no guarantee that a given query workload will be distributed equally among all sensors. That leads to data collisions which represent a major source of energy waste. In this paper we present the Energy-driven Tree Construction (ETC) algorithm, which balances the workload among nodes and minimizes data collisions, thus reducing energy consumption, during data acquisition in WSNs. We show through real micro-benchmarks on the CC2420 radio chip and trace-driven experimentation with real datasets from Intel Research and UC-Berkeley that ETC can provide significant energy reductions under a variety of conditions prolonging the longevity of a wireless sensor network.},

We propose two novel algorithms, UB-K and UBLB-K, which combine local computations of lower and upper bounds on the matching between the distributed subsequences and Q. Such an operation generates the desired result without pulling together all the distributed subsequences over the fundamentally expensive communication medium. Our solutions find applications in a wide array of domains, such as cellular networks, wildlife monitoring and video surveillance.

Assuming a typical tree-based aggregation scenario, the waking window is defined as the time interval t during which S enables its transceiver in order to collect the results from its children. Minimizing the length of t enables S to conserve energy that can be used to prolong the longevity of the network and hence the quality of results. Our method is established on profiling recent data acquisition activity and on identifying the bottlenecks using an in-network execution of the Critical Path Method. We show through trace-driven experimentation with a real dataset that MicroPulse can reduce the energy cost of the waking window by three orders of magnitude.},

Thus, our approach focuses on a subset V' (\subseteq V) that unveils only the k highest-ranked answers at the sink for some user defined parameter k. We additionally provide an elaborate description of energy-conscious algorithms for constructing, pruning and maintaining such recursively-defined in-network views.

Such measurements can then be utilized for i) education, ii) early diagnosis and iii) for defining early warning systems that identify when a human life is jeopardy. A problem with the current setting is that individual ICUs are limited to the locally acquired measurements. As a result, the number of clinically "interesting" episodes available to doctors is also very limited.

abstract = {One important problem in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is searching and retrieving the correct information. However, existing searching mechanisms in pure peer-to-peer networks are inefficient due to the decentralized nature of such networks. We propose two mechanisms for information retrieval in pure peer-to-peer networks. The first, the modified Breadth-First-Search (BFS) mechanism, is an extension of the current Gnuttela protocol, allows searching with keywords, and is designed to minimize the number of messages that are needed to search the network. The second, the Intelligent Search mechanism, uses the past behavior of the P2P network to further improve the scalability of the search procedure. In this algorithm, each peer autonomously decides which of its peers are most likely to answer a given query. The algorithm is entirely distributed, and therefore scales well with the size of the network. We implemented our mechanisms as middleware platforms. To show the advantages of our mechanisms we present experimental results using the middleware implementation.},

abstract = {Continuous queries in wireless sensor networks are established on the premise of a routing tree that provides each sensor with a path over which answers can be transmitted to the query processor. The number of tuples received by S in a given epoch e denotes the workload of S. Since the exact workload of a node is not known ahead of time, a node has to enable its transceiver for a sub-optimal amount of time in order to collect the results from its children. We found that this leads to an enormous waste of energy in predominant data acquisition frameworks such as TAG and Cougar. We found that these structures are sub-optimality constructed in predominant data acquisition systems leading to an enormous waste of energy. In this paper we present MicroPulse, a workload-aware optimization algorithm for query routing trees in wireless sensor networks. Our algorithm is established on profiling recent data acquisition activity and on identifying the bottlenecks using an in-network execution of the critical path method. A node S utilizes this information in order to locally derive the time instance during which it should wake up, the interval during which it should deliver its workload and the workload increase tolerance of its parent node. We additionally provide an elaborate description of energy-conscious algorithms for disseminating and maintaining the critical path cost in a distributed manner. Our trace-driven experimentation with real sensor traces from Intel Research Berkeley shows that MicroPulse can reduce the data acquisition costs by many orders.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce the distributed spatio-temporal similarity search problem: given a query trajectory Q, we want to find the trajectories that follow a motion similar to Q, when each of the target trajectories is segmented across a number of distributed nodes. We propose two novel algorithms, UB-K and UBLB-K, which combine local computations of lower and upper bounds on the matching between the distributed subsequences and Q. Such an operation generates the desired result without pulling together all the distributed subsequences over the fundamentally expensive communication medium. Our solutions find applications in a wide array of domains, such as cellular networks, wildlife monitoring and video surveillance. Our experimental evaluation using realistic data demonstrates that our framework is both efficient and robust to a variety of conditions.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce MINT (Materialized In-Network Top-k) Views, a novel framework for optimizing the execution of continuous monitoring queries in sensor networks. A typical materialized view V maintains the complete results of a query Q in order to minimize the cost of future query executions. In a sensor network context, maintaining consistency between V and the underlying and distributed base relation R is very expensive in terms of communication. Thus, our approach focuses on a subset V' (\subseteq V) that unveils only the k highest-ranked answers at the sink for some user defined parameter k. We additionally provide an elaborate description of energy-conscious algorithms for constructing, pruning and maintaining such recursively-defined in-network views. Our trace-driven experimentation with real datasets show that MINT offers significant energy reductions compared to other predominant data acquisition models.},
